{"instruction": "Explain what a black hole is in simple terms.", "response": "A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. It usually forms when a very massive star collapses at the end of its life."}
{"instruction": "List three renewable energy sources.", "response": "Three renewable energy sources are solar power, wind power, and hydropower."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the causes of World War I in one short paragraph.", "response": "World War I was caused by a mix of nationalism, secret alliances, militarism, and competition over colonies.

{"instruction": "Rewrite this sentence to be more formal: 'Kids should drink more water instead of soda.'", "response": "Children should drink more water instead of soda."}
{"instruction": "Give me a simple explanation of overfitting in machine learning.", "response": "Overfitting is when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and random patterns, so it performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data."}
{"instruction": "Compare supervised and unsupervised learning in one paragraph.", "response": "In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data where each example has an input and a correct output, so the model learns to map inputs to outputs. In unsupervised learning, the data does not have labels, and the model tries to find hidden patterns or structures, such as clusters or low-dimensional representations."}
{"instruction": "Explain photosynthesis in simple language.", "response": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make their own food. They produce sugar for energy and release oxygen into the air as a byproduct."}
{"instruction": "List four common data structures used in programming.", "response": "Four common data structures are arrays (or lists), stacks, queues, and hash maps (or dictionaries)."}
{"instruction": "Explain what an API is to a beginner.", "response": "An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules that lets one piece of software talk to another. It defines how to ask for data or actions and how the other program will respond."}
