And she, who lies there dead, was Romeos faithful wife. I married them. Their secret wedding day was the same day Tybalt died. His untimely death led to the banishment of the bridegroom. Juliet was distraught not over Tybalts death, but rather over Romeos banishment. To end her grief, you arranged for her to marry Count Paris. At that point she came to me, and, looking wild, threatened to kill herself unless I came up with a plan to help her escape this second marriage. Then I gave her a special sleeping potion that, as I had planned, made it seem as if she had died. Meanwhile, I wrote to Romeo to tell him to come here tonight, this awful night, to help get her out of her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off. But the man who carried my letter, Friar John, was stopped by an accident, and returned my letter to me last night. So at the time when Juliet was scheduled to wake up, I came here alone to take her out of her familys tomb. My plan was to hide her in my cell until I could get word to Romeo. But when I arrived, just a few minutes before Juliet awoke, Paris and Romeo were already here, lying dead. She woke up, and I begged her to come out of the tomb with me and bear this work of God with patience. But then a noise frightened me, and I ran from the tomb. She was too desperate to leave with me, and, it seems, she killed herself. I know all of this. And her Nurse knows about the marriage. If any of this misfortune is my fault, let me be sacrificed and punished under the strictest law.", "response": "We still have known thee for a holy man."}

You are a widow, but you're also a mother, and you still have the comfort of your children left.

And worse than that, inhuman traitors, you took something from her more precious than hands or tongueyou raped her. What would you say, if I let you speak? Villains, youd be ashamed to beg for mercy. Listen, miserable criminals! This is how I mean to kill you. I still have one hand left to cut your throats, while Lavinia holds between her stumps the basin that will receive your guilty blood.

I would gladly stick to the proper manners of courtship and deny everything I said. But, instead: I'll say goodbye to good manners! Do you love me? I know you will answer yes, and I will trust you. But your swears may turn out to be false. They say that Jove laughs when lovers lie. Oh, noble Romeo, if you really love me, say it in truth. Or if you think Im letting myself be won too easily, then Ill frown and act superior and unapproachable so that youll woo me. But if thats not necessary, then I would never act that way. In truth, beautiful Montague, I like you too much, which might make it seem as if I am overly silly and flirtatious. But trust me, gentleman, Ill prove to be more faithful than girls who act coy and standoffish. I probably should have acted more standoffish, I confess, but you overheard me talking about my passion for you before I knew you were there.

Now pick it up.", "response": "I swear to do this, though a present death Had been more merciful."}
{"instruction": "Because I think that she loved you as well as you love your lady Silvia. She dreams of the man who has forgotten her love.

{"instruction": "Who could say that I'm a villain, when I give free and honest advice that is helpful for Cassio in winning back the Moor's favor? For it really is easy to persuade Desdemona to help you in anything. She gives rise to as many good things as nature itself. And Othello is such a slave to his love for her that he would renounce his baptism and reject all symbols of Christian redemption to win her over. She can do whatever she wants, and whatever she desires he will carry out. How then could I be a villain, when I am advising Cassio to do what is in his best interest? That's Satan's theology! When devils do the worst sins, they first put on the pretense of goodness and innocence, as I am doing now. For while this honest fool begs Desdemona to fix his misfortune and while she pleads on his behalf to the Moor, I'll poison Othello's thoughts by whispering into his ear. I'll say that Desdemona is standing up for Cassio because she is attracted to him. The more that she argues for Cassio, the guiltier she'll seem to the Moor. In this way I'll turn her own virtue into a sort of tar, to entrap herand everyone elsewith her own goodness.", "response": "How now, Roderigo!"}

{"instruction": "Now the winter of our troubles has been transformed into glorious summer by the ascension of my brother, King Edward IV, son of the house of York. All the clouds that had descended over our family have now been banished and returned to the sea. Now we wear wreaths of victory on our foreheads, and we've hung up our armor as decoration. We've exchanged the sound of our battle trumpets for the sound of joyful greetings, and our death marches have become stately dances. The grim, warlike expressions on our faces have smoothed. And instead of charging on armored horses to frighten our opponents, we now dance in ladies' chambers to seductive songs on the lute. But as for me, I am not made for such games of love, or to admire myself in a mirror. I was badly made, and I lack the good looks to strut in front of passing girls. Nature has cheated me out of handsome features and proper proportions. I was born deformed, unfinished, and born prematurely. I was barely half-created when I came into the world, and left so lame and misshapen that dogs bark at me as I limp past them. In such delicate times of peace, I have nothing to do. No joys help me pass the time, unless I want to see my own shadow in the sun and make speeches about my deformity. Therefore, since I cannot amuse myself by being a lover during these peaceful days, I am determined to become a villain. I have hatched plots and put dangerous plans into action, using prophecies made while drunk; slander; and stories about dreams in order to set my brother George, Duke of Clarence, against my other brother, the king, so that they hate each other. If King Edward is as true as I am clever, false, and treacherous, then this very day Clarence will be imprisoned because of a prophecy that \"G\" will murder Edward's children.

The wheel spokes of her carriage are made of spiders legs; its cover is made of grasshopper wings; and its harnesses are made of the smallest spiderwebs. The horse collars are made from moonbeams, while her whip is a single cobweb attached to a cricket bone. Her wagon driver is a tiny gnat wearing a gray coat that is not even half as large as a little round worm that comes from the finger of a lazy young girl. Her carriage is an empty hazelnut, made by a squirrel and an old worm, which have been the fairies carriage-builders for countless years. With this magnificent carriage she rides each night through the brains of lovers, who then dream about love. She rides across courtiers knees, who then dream about bowing and curtsying. She rides over lawyers fingers, who then dream about their fees. She rides over ladies lips, and they immediately dream of kisses. But Queen Mab often puts blisters on their lips because their breath smells of candy, which angers her. Sometimes she rides over a courtiers nose, and he dreams of sniffing out a way to make some money. Sometimes she tickles a priests nose with the tail of pig given as a tithe to the church, and he dreams of getting a high-paid church position. Sometimes she drives over a soldiers neck, and he dreams of cutting the throats of foreigners, of breaking through fortifications, of ambushes, of the finest-quality Spanish swords, and of huge mugs of alcohol before suddenly waking, frightened, by the sound of drums in his ears. Then he says a prayer or two and goes back to sleep. Mab is the one who tangles the hair of horses manes at night and then hardens the tangles in the foul, dirty hairs; tangles which, if you undo them, bring bad luck.

If these things do happen, then your mother appeared to me last night in a dream that was so real, it felt like I was awake. Something walked toward me, moving its head from side to side. I've never seen anything so sad and so completely beautiful. In pure white robes, like a goddess, she walked toward the place where I was sleeping. She bowed three times, gasping as she tried to speak. Crying with rage, she finally burst out, \"Antigonus, you have the bad luck to be disposing of my baby far away in Bohemia. Shed a tear as you leave her there. Since she's lost forever, you should call her 'Perdita.' And for what my husband has made you do, you'll never see your wife, Paulina, again.\" Then, shrieking, she disappeared into thin air. Terrified, it took me a while to collect myself, and I wasn't sure if it was a dream or not. Usually I don't put much stock in dreams, but this one I'd swear by superstitiously. I believe that Hermione died, and that Apollo wants this baby (who must be King Polixenes's daughter) to be laid here on its father's land, to either live or die. [He places the baby on the ground in a basket with a letter and some jewels] Good luck! There you are, and there's the story of your identity. If you make it, these things might help you. The storm is beginning! Poor brat, you're out in the elements thanks to your mother's mistake, and who knows what will happen! I can't cry, but my heart is bleeding and I'm damned for getting tangled up in this. Goodbye! It's getting darker and darker. I'm afraid the lullaby you're about to get will be a little on the rough side; I've never seen the sky so black in the daytime. The thunder, the lightning! I need to get aboard the ship! [Walking away, he sees a bear running toward him] Well, this is it: I'm gone forever.", "response": "I would there were no age between sixteen and three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest; for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting Hark you now!"}

But then you have to admit that liars use their good looks to manipulate others into thinking they're good people! Your shrugs and your \"hmms\" show you're hesitant to say \"she's honest,\" right?

{"instruction": "Yesthere are a dozen, and in fact as many as would populate the whole world that they wagered for. But I think that if wives are unfaithful, it is their husbands' fault. Let's say they stop sleeping with us and give themselves to other women instead, or break out in fits of jealousy and impose restraints on us. Or let's say they hit us, or spitefully cut back on our allowance. Why, we feel resentment, and although we have some grace, we can still have some revenge, too. Let husbands know that their wives have good sense just like them. They see and smell and can taste both sweet and sour, just like their husbands can. What are they doing when they switch us out for other women? Is it for fun? I think so. And does physical attraction lead to it? I think so. Is it a weakness to do this wrong? I think so, too. And don't we have physical attractions, desire for fun, and weakness, just like men? They should treat us well, or else they should know that whatever bad things we do, we are only following their example.", "response": "Good night, good night."}

I'll make my will, then, like sick men do when they've experienced the world and, near death, are both sad and resigned to give up the joys experienced on earth.

And many things that bring no money can lead to great wealth in the end. This hard and undignified work would be dull and disgusting to me, but the woman for whom I am doing this makes what is awful seem wonderful. She makes my hard work seem like a pleasure. Oh, shes ten times more kind than her father is nasty, and hes completely nasty. Hes issued a severe command that I have to move thousands of these logs and put them in a stack.

{"instruction": "You sound like a doctor, Helicanus, but what you're prescribing me is something you'd hardly do yourself. You see, I went to Antioch where, as you know, I faced death for the chance to win a famously beautiful woman. I had hoped we would get married and have children together, heirs for my throne that would strengthen my rule in this country and delight my subjects. I thought she was beautiful in person, but listen: they were committing incest. Once I figured it out, her sinful father didn't lash out; he suddenly became very smooth. As you well know, it's time to be afraid when tyrants kiss you. I ran away in the dark of night and, once I got here, thought I was safe. I know Antiochus is a tyrant, and that he's probably getting increasingly paranoid about what I know. And if he suspects that I've told the world how he killed all of those princes, and slept with his own daughter, then there's no doubt that he'll invade our country on the pretense of me having offended him. Then the country will be plunged into war for my socalled offense, and many innocent people will die, and everyone I love, yourself included, will blame me for it", "response": "Alas, sir!"}

It's the mind that makes the body rich, after all, and just as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds, so honor can be seen through even the lowliest attire. What, is the jay more precious than the lark because his feathers are more beautiful? Or is the poisonous snake better than the eel because his patterned scales please the eye? Certainly not, good Kate. Therefore you aren't any less precious because of your poor clothes and lowly attire. If you consider it shameful, then lay the shame on me. So cheer up!

Though I ought to thank you for at least being honest thieves who do not hide behind some more respectable disguise, for there is thievery in other professions as well. Here's some gold, you dirty thieves. Go now and drink all the wine you can until you catch a deadly fever that makes your blood foam. Do not trust the doctor, though, because his cures are poisonous and he kills men even more often than you rob them, taking both money and lives. Wreak havoc as your occupation dictates, and like one being instructed in his occupation, I'll give you good examples of thieves. The sun is a thief for robbing water from the vast sea; the moon is a thief for snatching light off the sun; the sea is a thief as its tides surge forth, dissolve the moon into salty tears; the earth is a thief as it steals and feeds off the manure of animals. Everything is a thief, from the laws to its enforcement, which use their unlimited power to steal. And do not make yourselves the exception, go away and rob one another. Here's some more gold. Go cut some throats, because everyone you meet is a thief. Go to Athens, pillage shops, because nothing you steal will not come from a thief's pocket. Do not steal any less because I'm giving you this, more gold, which I hope may curse you! Amen.", "response": "Has almost charmed me from my profession, bypersuading me to it."}

{"instruction": "Oh, sir, calm yourself. I'm following him only so I can turn on him later. Maybe we can't all be leaders, but not all leaders can have loyal followers. All the time you see dutiful servants kneeling to their masters and working like mules for nothing but food. And when they get old, they're fired. These honest fools deserve to be whipped! There are others who take the appearance of duty and loyalty, but stay focused on their own interests. They put on a good show of serving their lords, and thrive in their subservient positions. But once they get enough money, they serve only themselves. These are the guys who really have some soul. That's the kind of servant I am. Believe me, as sure as your name is Roderigo: if I were the Moor, I would not want Iago as my servant. In following him, I'm really just following myself. God may judge me. I swear I'm not serving Othello out of love and duty, but merely appearing to, for my own purposes.

Why, if you give him enough gold he'll marry a puppet, a doll, or an old prostitute with a dozen diseases and not a tooth in her head.

{"instruction": "To please the king I did, but to please myself I cannot do it. Yet I don't know why I welcome such a guest as grief, except because I had to say goodbye to so sweet a guest as my sweet Richard.

For within the hollow crown that sits on the king's mortal head, Death keeps his court, and sits amusing himself, grinning at his power, allowing the king a breath, a little time, to be a monarch, be feared and kill with looks, feeling vain and self-satisfied, as if this thin wall of flesh were impenetrable brass.

The fact that Camillo ran away, on top of Hermione and Polixenes' disgusting hook-ups (even if we didn't see them, we have all the evidence except the visual proof), on top of everything else, makes putting Hermione on trial absolutely necessary. It would be wrong to go about something this serious haphazardly, so I've sent my servants Cleomenes and Dion (you know them; they're good guys) to Delphos, to Apollo's temple.

It makes me sad to see so many dip their meat into the blood of one man, and the crazy thing about it all is that he encourages them to do it! I wonder how men dare to trust other men. They should be cautious of letting them bring their knives to such a feast. It would keep them from eating so much, and probably save their lives too!

Tell Bartholomew I said this: if he wants to please me, he will conduct himself properly, copying the way he's seen noble ladies act towards their husbands. Let him attend to the drunkard like that: speaking softly, acting humble and polite, and saying things like, \"What does your Honor command your lady and humble wife to do, that she might show her devotion and love?\" And then with kind embraces, tempting kisses, and his head resting on the drunkard's breast, Bartholomew should weep as if he's overjoyed to see his noble husband restored to health after believing for the last seven years that he was no better than a poor, disgusting beggar.

I told him everything, even from when I was a boy, and spoke about disastrous turns of events, moving events on land and on sea, and about times I barely escaped imminent death by a hair's breadth. I told him about how I was taken prisoner by my enemy and sold into slavery, about how I was ransomed back and how I traveled around through vast caverns and empty deserts, through rough, rocky quarries and hills so high they touch heaven itself. I told him about the cannibals that eat other humans, called the Anthropophagi, and about strange men whose heads grow beneath their shoulders. Desdemona was always fascinated by these stories, but household chores would call her away. She did her chores quickly so she could come back and listen voraciously to my stories again. When I had some spare time, she asked me to expand on the story of my travels and fill her in on what she had only heard parts of. I agreed, and my tales often brought her to tears. When I finished my stories, she would sigh. She would always say things like, \"That was strange, very strange,\" or \"That was pitiful, so pitiful.\" She wished she hadn't heard the moving stories, but also wished that God had made her that kind of a man. She thanked me and told me that if I knew anyone who loved her, all he would have to do to woo her was to tell her my stories. Picking up on her hint, I spoke to her. She loved me for the dangers I had endured, and I loved her because she pitied me for having endured them. This is the only witchcraft I have used. Here comes the woman herself.

Praise the worst parts of a man and call them excellent. That is what you used to be told. You once gave your ears to men like bartenders give their ears to the worst villains and rascals.

We expect him to visit any day now, and when he does, what will he say when he finds our little princess in poor health? He'll wish he hadn't come so far, and he'll blame my husband and me for not taking care of you like we promised to do. Go, please. Walk, be happy, bring back those rosy cheeks we all love so much!

Come on, man, there are ways to gain back the general's favor. He's just in a bad mood, and he punished you because he had to in front of the men of Cyprus, not because he dislikes you.

The part of her that came from you could not stop her from dying, but the part she got from heaven gives her eternal life. The most you could hope for her was that she marry well. Your idea of heaven for her was that she move up the social ladder. Yet now you weep, even though she has risen up above the clouds, all the way to heaven itself? Oh, by mourning her death you love your child so poorly, going crazy even though she is well and in heaven. It is better for a girl to die young while her marriage is still fresh and loving than to be married for a long time. Dry your tears, and place your rosemary on this beautiful corpse.

Whether or not one is wealthy is only a matter of luck: if an ox is born into abundant pastures, he will grow fat, whereas if he is born into scarcity, he will grow thin. Who? Who will dare to stand up for what's right and call a man a flatterer? After all, if one man is a flatterer, so is everyone, because every level in a hierarchy is flattered by the one below it. Smart men bow to rich fools. Everything is ridiculous, because we have nothing rational within our nature, just straight villainy. Thus I hate all feasts, society, and groups of people!

If I were in England now, as I was once before, and had a painting that showed this fish, every single fool there would give me a silver coin just to look at it. In England, this monster would make a man rich. But, then again, any strange beast there is just like a man. English people wont give a penny to help a lame beggar, but theyll give ten to see a dead Indian. This monster here has legs like a man but fins for arms! Hes still warm, too, by my faith. I no longer think this is a fish. I think now that its a native of the island whos been struck by a lightning bolt.", "response": "Alas, the storm is come again!"}

When you get married, let sorrow haunt your bed, and may your wifeif any woman is crazy enough to marry yoube made more miserable by your life than you've made me by my dear husband's death.\" But alas! Before I could even repeat my curse again, my woman's heart stupidly fell prey to his honeyed words. I then proved the victim of my own soul's curse.

When you need it, though I hope the gods will protect you from such a situation, it will defend you.\" I've always had it with me and have always loved it. I'd never been separated from it until the storm, which doesn't spare anyone, took it in its rage. Now that it's calmed, it's given it back again. I thank you for it.

But he does send them after me for every little thing I do. Sometimes his spirits come after me in the form of apes, chattering and making faces at me and then biting me. Sometimes they come in the shape of porcupines, lying curled up on the paths where I walk barefoot and pricking me when I step down. Sometimes poisonous snakes wrap around me, hissing with their forked tongues until I go crazy.", "response": "Lo, now, lo!"}

Your rhetoric reaches almost to the point of labor as it tries to turn murder into a mere formality and feuding into an act of valor. Feuds actually prove to be valor in its most degenerate form, as they come from the formation of rivalries. A man is truly valiant only when he can endure the worst insults men can speak, and even wear them like clothing without a care in the world. True valor never takes injury to heart, or retaliates in violence.

His advice would be like gold to me right now. My soul makes the same strong argument as my senses, which is that all this is some mistake, but that I'm not crazy.

Loves messengers should be thoughts, which fly ten times faster than sunbeams and drive the shadows back over the dark and scowling hills. Thats how fast swift-winged doves carry the goddess of love in her chariot, and why Cupid has wings that propel him as quickly as the wind. Now the sun is at its highest point in the skyits noon. Three hours have passed since nine oclock, and yet she hasnt returned. If she were young and in love, shed move as fast as a struck tennis ball. My words would bounce her to my sweet love, and his words would bounce her back to me. But old people act as though theyre already deadawkward, slow, heavy, and pale as lead. Oh God, shes here!

{"instruction": "I was willing to condemn my own brother to death, and now you want me to pardon a servant? My brother Clarence didn't kill anyone. His only fault was his ideas, and yet he was punished with bitter death. Who pled on his behalf? When I was so angry, who kneeled at my feet and asked me to think about what I was doing? Who spoke to me about brotherhood? Who spoke about love? Who told me how the poor soul abandoned his father-in-lawthe mighty Earl of Warwickto come fight for me? Who told me of the battlefield at Tewkesbury, where Clarence rescued me when Oxford had me down, saying, \"Dear brother, live, and be a king?\" Who told me how, when we both lay in the field almost freezing to death, he wrapped me in his own clothes and left himself naked, exposed to the mercy of the numbingly cold night? All this seemed erased from my memory in my brutish rage, and not a man of you had the grace to remind me. But when your servants drunkenly kill someone and scorn the law of our dear Christ, you immediately get on your knees and beg, \"pardon, pardon.\" And I, unfair as I am, must give it to you. [Stanley rises] But no one spoke on behalf my brother, and I didn't speak to myself on his behalf either, the poor soul. Even the proudest among you owed him something, and yet none of you would beg for his life.
